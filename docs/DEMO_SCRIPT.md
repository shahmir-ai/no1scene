3. **Show:** Loading progress, avatar appears in 3D viewport
4. **Point out:** Avatar automatically appears with default pose

### 2. Load Second Avatar (10 seconds)
1. **Action:** Upload second avatar file
2. **Narration:** "I can load multiple characters for group compositions."
3. **Show:** Second character appears, overlapping with first

2. **Narration:** "Finally, I export a high-quality 1920x1080 snapshot that artists can use as a reference."
3. **Show:** Export process, downloaded file

### Closing (5 seconds)
"This reference image now serves as a blueprint for artists to create the final photorealistic thumbnail, dramatically speeding up our production workflow."

## Key Points to Emphasize
- **Speed:** Entire process takes under 2 minutes
- **Quality:** Professional-grade 3D output
- **Workflow:** Replaces lengthy email chains and sketches
- **Flexibility:** Multiple characters, poses, lighting, backgrounds
- **Purpose:** Reference for artists, not final output

## Technical Notes
- Record at 1920x1080 for clarity
- Use smooth mouse movements
- Pause briefly after each major action
- Keep UI panels visible
- Show both the 3D viewport and control panels
- Demonstrate real-time updates

## Backup Demo Flow (If Issues)
If IK or complex features fail:
1. Focus on avatar loading and positioning
2. Demonstrate camera presets and lighting
3. Show expression controls
4. Export functionality
5. Emphasize the "blueprint for artists" concept

## Assets Needed
- **Avatar 1:** Heroic character with wave-friendly arm rig
- **Avatar 2:** Secondary character with good facial morph targets
- **HDRI:** Studio or outdoor environment
- **Backup files:** In case of loading issues

## Success Criteria
- All major features demonstrated
- Smooth, professional presentation
- Clear value proposition communicated
- Final export downloaded successfully
- Under 90 seconds total runtime
